# AutoML Pipeline for Binary Classification

This repository contains an automated machine learning (AutoML) pipeline for binary classification tasks. The pipeline includes feature selection, feature engineering, model training, and blending of predictions from multiple models. It leverages **AutoGluon** and **LightAutoML** for model training and optimization.

---

## 🚀 **What does this code do?**

The pipeline performs the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Removes non-numeric columns and handles missing values.
   - Filters out columns with low variance.

2. **Feature Selection**:
   - Uses LightGBM to select the top 15 most important features based on feature importance.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Generates new features by combining existing ones (multiplication, division, trigonometric transformations).

4. **Feature Selection with Boruta**:
   - Applies the Boruta algorithm to further refine the feature set.

5. **Data Balancing**:
   - Downsamples the majority class to handle class imbalance.

6. **Model Training**:
   - Trains models using **AutoGluon** and **LightAutoML**.
   - Optimizes for ROC-AUC metric.

7. **Blending Predictions**:
   - Blends predictions from AutoGluon and LightAutoML using an optimal weight combination.

8. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluates the blended model using ROC-AUC.

## 🖥️ **How to Run**

1. **Prepare Your Data**:
   - Ensure your data is in a `.parquet` file with a binary target column named `target`.

2. **Run the Pipeline**:
   - Execute the `main.py` script:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

3. **Output**:
   - The script will output the best weights for blending and the corresponding ROC-AUC score.

3. **NVIDIA Drivers**:
   - Install the latest NVIDIA drivers for your GPU.

4. **PyTorch with CUDA**:
   - Install PyTorch with CUDA support:
     ```bash
     pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
     ```

5. **AutoGluon with GPU**:
   - Ensure AutoGluon is installed with GPU support:
     ```bash
     pip install "autogluon[all]"
     ```
